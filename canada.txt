impacts of the pandemic on canadian competitiveness remain an open question
business productivity has fallen back to pre-pandemic levels the sharp increase in productivity early in the pandemic in part reflected the shift in hours worked from less to more productive industries when many non-essential businesses were shuttered business productivity has declined since mid-2020 as non-essential businesses ramped up their activities
overall business productivity in the fourth quarter of 2021 was 12% below levels observed in late 2019 
growing pressures on cost competitiveness unit labour costs in the business sector which measure the payments to labour required to produce a unit of output were up 60% year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2021 and have trended higher over the course of the pandemic
non-residential business investment has been slow to recover important drivers of productivity and wage growth non-residential outlays on structures and machinery and equipment were still 62% below pre-pandemic levels in late 2021 and down nearly one quarter from levels observed before the oil price shock in the mid-2010s 
business spending on research and development scaled back during the second half of 2021 and was 11% below pre-pandemic levels late in the year 
investments in digital technologies and the longer-term impacts of working from home may be important factors affecting business competitiveness

looking forward
the unintended health impacts of covid-19 restrictions along with the impacts of post covid-19 condition will be felt for years and will continue to strain health care resources
recent protests against pandemic restrictions are indicative of growing divisions among canadians and the potential long-term impacts on social cohesion are difficult to predict
canadas population grew at almost twice the pace of other g7 countries from 2016 to 2021 primarily from immigration prior to the pandemic lower immigration during covid-19 coupled with structural pressures related to population aging will continue to impact labour market imbalances
to what extent will the accelerated shift towards automation and digital technologies in low-wage sectors create new employment opportunities?
high inflation and modest wage gains suggest that pressures related to affordability will worsen in the near term—especially if prices for food and shelter continue to rise
financial barriers to homeownership may have lasting impacts on social and economic mobility especially for new canadians and younger families
as targeted wage subsidies and lockdown supports wind down businesses in high-contact sectors face continued uncertainty as input costs rise and vacancies remain near record levels 
will digitalization and working from home lead to permanent increases in businesses productivity?
